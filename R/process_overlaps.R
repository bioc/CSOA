#' Rank cell set overlaps
#'
#' This function ranks cell set overlaps.
#'
#' @details Overlap ranks are calculated as follows:
#'
#' 1. Two preliminary overlap ranks are computed based on:
#' 1) adjusted p-value;
#' 2) recorded-over-expected size ratio.
#'
#' 2. If \code{adjustRanks} is set to \code{TRUE}, preliminary ranks are
#' replaced by \strong{connectivity-based ranks} (\code{pvalRank},
#' \code{ratioRank}). For each edge corresponding to an overlap, the p-value
#' rank is replaced by the average of the minimum p-value ranks of the
#' vertices neighboring the two genes. The ratio rank is replaced similarly.
#'
#' 3. A raw aggregate rank (\code{rawAggRank}) is computed as the average of
#' \code{pvalRank} and \code{ratioRank}.
#'
#' 4. A final aggregate rank (\code{rank}) defined as the order imposed by the
#' raw aggregate rank is constructed.
#'
#'
#' @param overlapDF An overlap data frame.
#' @param adjustRanks Whether to adjust the ranks based on connectivity within
#' the graph of overlaps.
#'
#' @return A data frame with ranked overlaps.
#'
#' @keywords internal
